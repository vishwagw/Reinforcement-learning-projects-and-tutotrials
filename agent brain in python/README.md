This part of code is the DQN brain, which is a brain of the agent.
All decisions are made in here.
Using Tensorflow to build the neural network.

        For example in this batch I have 2 samples and 3 actions:
        q_eval =
        [[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6]]

        q_target = q_eval =
        [[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6]]

        Then change q_target with the real q_target value w.r.t the q_eval's action.
        For example in:
            sample 0, I took action 0, and the max q_target value is -1;
            sample 1, I took action 2, and the max q_target value is -2:
        q_target =
        [[-1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, -2]]

        So the (q_target - q_eval) becomes:
        [[(-1)-(1), 0, 0],
         [0, 0, (-2)-(6)]]

        We then backpropagate this error w.r.t the corresponding action to network,
        leave other action as error=0 cause we didn't choose it.
