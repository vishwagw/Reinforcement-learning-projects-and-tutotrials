Cart pole is a classic reinfoecement environment learning problem that is ued by many experts to teach or understand the basic mechanism of artificial reinfromcement learning.

out goal is to solve the problem by balancing a pole on a cart by apllying forces to the left or right.

In this project we use libraires:
numpy- numerical python
gym
warnings 

Gym is a python library package. It is short for gymnasium.
We used this package to load a deisired enviorment for our program.

Envionment setup :
after loading the diesired enviroment to run the program, we must specifically render the human mode so we can visually see the process through desired enviroment.

state and action spaces:
we print the state and action spaces to understand the dimensions and the types of actions that are available.

ramdom actions :
the agent takes random actions for first few steps, and the state transitions, rewards, and other information are printed for every and each step.
If an episode endss, the environment is programmed to reset and to start a new episode.

End note:
This is just a basic program to solve a classic problem.
So, this is a simple usecase of reinforcement learning in python.
Follwing are the common use cases of reinforcement learning:
1. robotics
2. Game playing
3. personalized training system

Here is some advanteges of reinforcement learning:
1. solving complex and wide range of problems including decision making, control, optimization by using computers
2. these models can corrrect errors that happen during the training process.
3. training data is obtained via direct interaction of the agent with the enviroment.
